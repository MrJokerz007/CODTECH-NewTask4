CSS Modules or styled-components promote maintainable and scalable CSS by scoping styles to individual components.

UI libraries offer pre-built components and styling, accelerating development and ensuring a consistent design.

Thorough testing and cross-browser compatibility are crucial for a seamless user experience.

Deploying to a hosting service enables easy access and scalability for the e-learning platform.
